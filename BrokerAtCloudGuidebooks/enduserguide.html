                    <p> From the perspective of a service provider a broker policy is a "semantic and syntactic template" for a service description that enables the service provider to describe its service offering in terms understandable by the broker. For more details see the section <a href="csbexpertguide.html#policyWhat"> What is a Broker Policy?</a> in the Cloud Service Brokerage Expert and Developer Guide.</p>

                    <section id="policiesMgmt">
                        <h2>Creation and Management of Broker Policies</h2>
                        <p>The Cloud Service Brokerage Platform Expert and Developer Guide is dealing in detail with all aspects around creation and management of broker policies in the <a href="csbexpertguide.html#policyDev">Broker Policy Development</a>. You need a file with a valid broker policy. The broker policy should also be <a href="csbexpertguide.html#policyDep">deployed</a> in your test system before you proceed with the next section.</p>

                    <h1>Creation and management of service descriptions</h1>
                    <p><em>Learn how to create and publish a service description</em></p>
                    <p>Similarly to a broker policy, a service description is described in Linked USDL with some specific extensions and conventions introduced in the <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/brokeratcloud/documents/deliverables/d30-2-methods-and-tools-for-brokerage-enabling-description-of-enterprise-cloud-services"> Broker@Cloud methodology</a>. Linked USDL is specified in RDF Schema on top of a number of RDF Schema ontologies like <a href="http://www.heppnetz.de/projects/goodrelations/">Good Relations</a>. Hence, a text editor is the most flexible way to specify a service description that can potentially use the full modelling power offered through the ontologies linked into the Linked USDL. In this case, the broker can also take into consideration and specify in the broker policy aspects that might be relevant for the cloud service brokerage platform but are not covered by the minimal requirements on a broker policy and service description specified by the Broker@Cloud framework. Using a text-based RDF-editor, like the rdfEditor contained in the <a href="http://www.dotnetrdf.org/">dotNetRDF</a> Toolkit improves not only readability but also provides some usefull syntactic checks.</p>
                    <p>The modelling power and flexibility of Linked USDL has also a downside. Depending on the type and complexity of a broker policy, creation of a valid service description using a text-based editor might prove to be a time consuming and an error-prone procedure. We are offering two kinds of support tools: graphical service description editors for both types of broker policy and REST APIs for service description validity checking offered by the SC<sup>3</sup> mechanism. A graphical service description editor significantly simplifies the creation of a service description. However, only creation of a minimal service description is supported, i.e., only creation of parts absolutelly necessary to satisfy the Broker@Cloud requirements on a Service Description specification is supported. The validity checking REST APIs offered by the SC<sup>3</sup> mechanism check any service description specified in Linked USDL if it is compliant with respect to the Broker@Cloud requirements on a Service Description specification and with respect to the broker policy the service description refers to.</p>

                        <p>Broker@Cloud project is operating an instance of a Broker@Cloud framework that can be used for different testing and validation tasks. This instance can be used also for validation of your service descriptions. Of course, you can use also your own Broker@Cloud instance if you already installed one.</p>

                        <h3>SD validation using Broker@Cloud framework test instance (operated by Broker@Cloud)</h3>
                        <p>First of all, you have to deploy the broker policy you used for the creation of your service description to the Broker@Cloud test instance if not already done. See <a href="csbexpertguide.html#policyDep">Broker Policy Deployment</a> section for further instructions.</p>
                        <p> Second, POST your service description to the following URL:<code>http://213.249.38.66:3335/org.seerc.brokeratcloud.webservice/rest/serviceDescription/validate</code>
                        </p>
                        <p>For testing purposes, you can use e.g., <a href="http://thomas-bayer.com/restgate/index.do">RESTGate</a> - a web-based client for REST services to test online or download a REST client for your browser like this <a href="https://github.com/jeremys/Simple-Rest-Client-Chrome-Extension">Simple Rest Client for Google Chrome</a>.</p>
                        <p>The following two screenshots show the validation request and response of a <a href="docs/myservicedescription.ttl">valid service description</a> based on a <a href="docs/SAP-broker-policy-template-including-classification-taxonomy.ttl">valid commented broker policy of Type2</a> in the <a href="http://thomas-bayer.com/restgate/index.do">RESTGate</a> client. </p>

                            <p>The purpose of this step is to prepare the hierarchy of optimisation attributes for use in consumer preference profiles. This hierarchy must conform to the business model of cloud broker and include meaningful attributes that can be monitored and exploited for service selection. A default optimisation attribute hierarchy based on SMICloud work is provided, however it is up to cloud broker to use it (actually load it into pulsar), create a new hierarchy from scratch or use the provided hierarchy with modifications.</p>
                            <p>To load the default optimisation attribute hierarchy you need to log in with administrator account and then select <code>Import</code> menu item. Then click somewhere in the white box to open file selection dialog box. Find and select the optimisation attribute hierarchy file (typically named as <code>service-attributes-hierarchy-FINAL.ttl</code>). Finally click <code>Open</code> button and wait until file is uploaded into RDF repository.</p>

                            <p>To modify an attribute just select it in the left-hand-side list and wait for its data to load in the edit pane in the central area of the page. Then edit any field that can be changed and click <code>Save Changes</code> to store them in RDF repository. To create a new attribute select its parent attribute or a sibling attribute in the left-hand-side list and click <code>Create sibling</code> or <code>Create child</code> button. Don't forget to set the <code>Id</code> field to a unique value.</p>

                            <h3>Mapping optimisation attributes to classification dimensions</h3>
                            <p>The purpose of this step is to associate the optimisation attributes with the classification dimensions (or functional categories) of the Broker Policy. It is possible to associate different attributes to each classification dimension, in order to enable pulsar present to consumers only the attributes relevant to the selected classification dimensions (see Consumer preference management for more information). If this feature is not desired or meaningful in your case then map all attributes onto the root classification dimension.</p>

                            <p>To create the attribute-to-dimension association you need to log in with administrator account and then select <code>Attr. Mapping</code> menu item. Then on a classification dimension in the left-hand-side list and wait until all relevant associations are loaded in the edit grid in the central area of the page.</p>

                            <p>Right click somewhere in the grid or list. When popup menu appears select <code>New attribute</code> item. Then page will be dimmed and the "Optimisation Attribute Selection" dialog box will appear. This dialog box contains the optimisation attribute hierarchy. You can expand it and select the attributes you want to associate with the (previously) selected classification dimension. When ready click <code>Insert</code> (it is above the list).</p>
                            <a href="images/pulsar-Picture3.jpg" class="thumbnail" data-toggle="lightbox"><img src="images/pulsar-Picture3.jpg" alt="PuLSaR Recommendations" class="img-responsive"></a>
                            <p>After clicking "Insert" the dialog box disappears, the main page is undimmed and new associations are added in the grid for the selected attributes. Subsequently it is possible to edit association information such as Unit, Type, Allowed values, descriptive labels (in English and German) etc. Please note that as you move from field to field any changes are automatically saved.</p>

PuLSaR can help simplifying the weight assignment task using a decision making method called Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). AHP transforms the criteria weights calculation problem into a series of pairwise comparisons.</p>
